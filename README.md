# Template Application IExternalApplication

In this section, we will create a template for our IExternalCommand applications so that we don't have to follow all the steps we saw in Project 2 each time we want to create an application of this type.

## STEP 1 - Set up work template

Through of the editor code VISUAL STUDIO CODE we choose the framework 4.8 to use and select a class library template. This template will allow us to access the revit libraries.

  In this case, we only complete the first two fields; however, an image can be added for the icon if desired.
